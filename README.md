# 🎈 Balloon Journey - Flash Animation Project

This is a **basic animation project** created using **Macromedia Flash 8** as part of an academic submission.

## 🧒 Storyline

The animation tells a heartfelt and symbolic story:

A small boy accidentally loses grip of his balloon. As he watches it fly away into the sky, he becomes sad and begins to cry. The balloon, however, travels far and is eventually found by another boy in a different place. This boy, initially sad, becomes happy upon receiving the balloon.

## ✨ Moral of the Story

> *"Someone's happiness may be someone else's sorrow, and someone's sorrow may bring joy to someone else."*

This simple animation aims to portray how perspectives and outcomes differ across lives, often shaped by the same events.
